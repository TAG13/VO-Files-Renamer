VO Files Renamer - Read Me

=== Quick Instructions ===

Place this Python file in the same folder as the audio file(s) you want to rename.

Edit the python files (notepad will work) and adjust the variables at the top of the python file as needed for you project.
For the prefix and suffix variables, be sure to include
    apostrophes or quotation marks at the beginning and
    end of your values. For example:
    prefix = 'Narrator_'
FileNameLength is used to limit the size of your file name,
    measured in characters.
    This variable does not take into account the prefix or suffix.
If camelCase is set to True, then each word will be
    capitalized and all spaces removed. For example:
    "How are you.wav" becomes "HowAreYou.wav"

=== Information about this program ===

This little program renames audio files to what is actually said in the file. It's intended for use in video game development, where there can be hundreds or thousands of short dialog lines. 
This program uses speech-to-text to "listen" to the audio file, then generate text to rename the file. The speech-to-text api used is Google Web Speech, which requires an online connection.

This program also formats the text in various ways. You have the option to:
-add prefixes or suffixes to the file name
-limit the length of the file name (measured in characters)
-camel case: capitalize each word and remove spaces

Planned features:
-basic UI
-choose different output path
-drag and drop files?!
